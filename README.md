# README

This is a takehome assignment from sprintfwd that is listed here: https://gist.github.com/mkyaw/401788d0ee6fceb444b9b5820a64d1a1


This assignment presumes the following about Users and Teams

User has only a `name` and a `team_id` attribute that can be updated

Team has only a `name` that can be updated

These assumptions are built into the databases that were created for these Rails models and can be verified in `db/migrate` folder
